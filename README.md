# üìÑ Description

This repository contains a python application that uses the PySpark library to process Big Data pipelines of MNO Data
and generate multiple stadistical products related to mobility and sociodemographic analysis.

The code stored in this repository is aimed to be executed in a PySpark compatible cluster and to be deployed in 
cloud environments like AWS, GCP or Azure. Nevertheless, the code can be launched in local environments using a single 
node Spark configuration once all the required libraries have been correctly set. 

For an easy deployment in local environments, configuration for creating a docker container 
with all the setup done is provided in this repository.

# üìú Code Documentation

Please refer to the following website: https://eurostat.github.io/multimno/latest/

# üÖøÔ∏è Pipeline

The pipeline of Big Data processing performed by the software can be found at 
the following document: [MultiMNO Pipeline](docs/pipeline.md)

# üõ†Ô∏è Mandatory Requirements

Please verify that your system fullfils the [System Requirements.](docs/system_requirements.md#system-libraries) in order to assert that your system can execute the code. 

# üì¶ Synthetic data

MNO synthetic data is given in the repository under the `sample_data/lakehouse/bronze` directory. This data 
has been generated synthetically and contains the following specs:  

- üåç **Spatial scope:** All data has been generated in a bounding box that covers the metropolitan area of Madrid.
 The bounding box parameters are as follows:
  - latitude_min = 40.352
  - latitude_max = 40.486
  - longitude_min = -3.751
  - longitude_max = -3.579


- üìÜ **Temporal scope :** Data has been generated for 9 days, from 2023-01-01 to 2023-01-09 both included.
- üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**Users:** 100 different users.
- üì°**Network:** 500 different cells.
  
# üèÅ Quickstart

## Setup
Use the following commands for a fast setup of an execution environment using docker. 

> Please check the [Setup Guide](docs/UserManual/setup_guide.md) for a more indepth detail
>  of the system setup to execute the code.

Build docker image
```bash
docker build -t multimno:1.0-prod --target=multimno-prod .
```

## Execution

Run an example pipeline within a container:
```bash
docker run --rm --name=multimno-container -v "${PWD}/sample_data:/opt/data" -v "${PWD}/pipe_configs:/opt/app/pipe_configs" multimno:1.0-prod pipe_configs/pipelines/pipeline.json
```

This command will:
- Create a docker container.
- mount the `sample_data` directory in `/opt/data` within the container.
- mount the `pipe_configs` directory in `/opt/app/pipe_configs` within the container.
- Execute a pipeline stored in `/opt/app/pipe_configs/pipelines/pipeline.json` within the container. This is the same file
as the one in the repository.
- Delete the container once the execution finishes.

> NOTE: It is necessary to adjusts paths in the pipeline.json and in the general_configuration.ini 
> file if the destination paths are altered.

### Dockerfile Lite

As the multimno software is a python application designed to be executed in a Spark cluster, a lightweight Dockerfile called `Dockerfile-lite` is given for execution of the software in existing Spark clusters.

Please refer to [Lite section](docs/UserManual/setup_guide.md#docker-lite-version) of the setup guide on details on how to use this deployment. 

# üìì User Manual

A user manual is provided composed of three sections:
* [Configuration](docs/UserManual/configuration/index.md): Section containing the explanation of all the configuration files used by the software. 
* [Setup Guide](docs/UserManual/setup_guide.md): How to prepare the system for the software execution.
* [Execution Guide](docs/UserManual/execution.md): How to execute the software.

how to contribute to the multimno repository.

# üñ•Ô∏è Developement Guidelines

Please follow the [development guidelines](docs/DevGuide/2_dev_guidelines.md) to setup a dev-environment and 
see the recommended best practices for development, testing and documentation.
